This is a Django-based portfolio website currently under development. It allows me to showcase my skills, projects, and experience in a professional and dynamic way.

**Sections:**

* **Home:** Displays my personal information, including name, title, a brief bio, and a professional headshot.
* **Projects:** Lists my past and current projects, highlighting my technical skills and accomplishments. Each project will have a detailed description, images, and links to live demos or repositories.
* **Documents:** Provides a centralized location for my resume, certificates, and marksheets. Users can download these documents directly from the website.
* **Contact:** Includes a contact form allowing visitors to easily reach out to me with inquiries or collaboration opportunities.
